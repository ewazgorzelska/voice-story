# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - Voice Story App

## 1. Product Overview

The Voice Story App is a web application that allows users to create personalized bedtime stories for children, narrated in the user's own voice. By recording a short voice sample, the application uses AI-powered voice cloning to generate audio narrations for a predefined library of classic fairy tales. The primary goal of the MVP is to provide a simple and magical experience for parents to create unique stories for their children.

## 2. User Problem

Parents often seek new and engaging ways to connect with their children, especially during moments like bedtime. Traditional storytelling is a cherished activity, but parents may lack the time or variety of stories to keep it fresh. The Voice Story App solves this by enabling a parent, grandparent, or loved one to "narrate" a story using their own voice, even when they are not physically present, creating a comforting and personal experience for the child.
